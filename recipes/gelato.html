<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups milk</li>
  <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
  <li>4 egg yolks</li>
  <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
  <li>Mix milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Warm until foam forms around the edges. Remove from heat.</li>
  <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar until frothy in a large bowl. Gradually pour the warm milk into egg yolks and sugar,
    whisking constantly. Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the
    mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat
    immediately.</li>
  <li>Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for several hours or overnight.
  </li>
  <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a
    sealed container, and freeze until firm. If the gelato is too firm, place it in the refrigerator until it reaches
    the desired consistency.
